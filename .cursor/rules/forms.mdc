# How to do forms

- We are using `react-hook-form` as hook for forms and `zod` for validation with combination with DTOs in shared dir
- We use DTOs from shared directory because we want to have same validation rules across frontend and backend
- Even if it's UI task, implement proper forms handling to be safe in the future
